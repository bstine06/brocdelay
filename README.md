# BrocDelay

A healthy choice for your delay needs!

Currently, this plugin functions as a basic feedback delay. It features feedback, delay time, gain, and mix parameters. There is a toggle for a "flip-flop" setting, which inverts the stereo field of the input signal on each repetition of the delay feedback. I also plan to implement filtering to make this a more a useful audio effect.

This is my first audio effect plugin. I am using JUCE 8 with the Projucer GUI and following along with the concepts found in [The Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Audio Plug-in Development by Matthijs Hollemans](https://www.theaudioprogrammer.com/books/beginners-plugin-book).

This project is still early in development. There is a [pre-release available here](https://github.com/bstine06/brocdelay/releases) if you would like to test it's current functionality. Stay tuned for updates!
