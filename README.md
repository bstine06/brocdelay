# BrocDelay

A healthy choice for your delay needs!

Currently, this plugin functions as a basic feedback delay. I plan to implement steroization and filtering to make this a more a useful audio effect.

This is my first audio effect plugin. I am using JUCE 8 with the Projucer GUI and following along with the concepts found in [The Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Audio Plug-in Development by Matthijs Hollemans](https://www.theaudioprogrammer.com/books/beginners-plugin-book).

This project is still early in development. As such there are no releases currently available. Stay tuned for updates!
